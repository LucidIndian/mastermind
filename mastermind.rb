# Classes: Player, Computer, Mastermind

# Player vs. computer

# - 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.
# - Later, refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.

# Classes

# - Mastermind
# - Player < codemaker
# - Player < codebreaker

# Mastermind methods
	
# 	play:

# - The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs (of six different colors). Players decide in advance whether duplicates and blanks are allowed.
# - codemaker chooses pattern (not visible to codebreaker)
# - The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns.
# - guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the decoding board are full.
# - scoring: "The codemaker gets one point for each guess the codebreaker makes. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker is unable to guess the exact pattern within the given number of turns.
# - winner_check: "The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon number of games are played.
